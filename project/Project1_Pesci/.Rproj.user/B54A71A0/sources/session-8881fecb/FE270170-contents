```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Packages

*Always* activate the needed packages with `library()` function call when you start to write R code. Mostly, we will be using **tidyverse** (for data analyses) and **here** (for detecting where your files live) packages.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```

## Import the data

```{r}
vdem <- here("vdem_subset.csv") %>%
  read.csv()

```


## Assignment 1
How many variables and observations there are in the vdem data?

Answer: There are 6 variables and 27555 observations in the vdem data.

```{r}
vdem %>% 
  glimpse()

```


## Assignment 2
Subset the vdem data to include only the variables country_name , year , and v2x_libdem and
observations from year 2022. Create a new data frame for these data and name it as vdem_libdem_2022 .   


```{r}
vdem_libdem_2022 <- vdem %>%
  select(country_name, year, v2x_libdem) %>%
  filter(year == "2022")
vdem_libdem_2022

```


## Assignment 3

Find out which five countries score highest on liberal democracy index (column: v2x_libdem ) in the
vdem_libdem_2022 data frame.

Find out the number of unique liberal democracy index scores in vdem_libdem_2022 data frame.


Answer:
1	Denmark		    0.889	
2	Sweden		    0.870	
3	Norway	    	0.857	
4	Switzerland		0.851	
5	Estonia     	0.847	


Answer: There are 161 distinct liberal democracy index scores in vdem_libdem_2022 data.
 

```{r}
vdem_libdem_2022 %>%
 arrange(desc(v2x_libdem)) %>%
  head(5)

libdem_uniq <- vdem_libdem_2022 %>%
  distinct(select(vdem_libdem_2022, v2x_libdem))
libdem_uniq %>%
  glimpse()

```

## Assignment 4

Let’s imagine a following scenario: you’re working in a research project dealing with comparing the state of
democracy across the world. You have discovered the V-Dem dataset and want to use the liberal democracy
index data for year 2022 in the final report of the project. 
Your boss likes the idea, but wants this scale to vary from 0 to 10 instead of 0 to 1, as in the original V-Dem data
because other indices in the final report also vary from 0 to 10. Create a new variable libdem_0_to_10 that
captures the liberal democracy index, but ranging from 0 to 10 instead of 0 to 1. 



```{r}
vdem_libdem_2022 %>%
  mutate(libdem_0_to_10 = v2x_libdem * 10) %>%
  arrange(desc(libdem_0_to_10)) %>%
  select(-v2x_libdem)

```

## Assignment 5

Calculate the mean and median for liberal democracy index in 2022.
Calculate minimum and maximum years present in the vdem data.

Answer: The mean for liberal democracy index in 2022 is 0.3857877.
Answer: The median for liberal democracy index in 2022 is 0.365.

Answer: minimum year present in the vdem data is 1789.
Answer: maximum year present in the vdem data is 2022.


```{r}

summarise(vdem_libdem_2022, avg_mean_libdem = mean(v2x_libdem),
          median_libdem = median(v2x_libdem))

summarise(vdem, min_year = min(year),
          max_year = max(year))

```

## Assignment 6

Calculate mean liberal democracy index, v2x_libdem , by countries. Find out which are the top and bottom three countries on liberal democracy index. 

Answer: The top 3 liberal democracies in vdem_mean_libdem_historical are Slovenia, Ireland, and Iceland.
Answer: The 3 least liberal democratic countries in vdem_mean_libdem_historical are Eritrea, Ethiopia, and North Korea.

```{r}
vdem_mean_libdem_historical <- 
 vdem %>% 
 group_by(country_name) %>% 
 summarise(mean_libdem = mean(v2x_libdem)) %>% 
 arrange(desc(mean_libdem)) %>% 
 drop_na()
vdem_mean_libdem_historical %>% 
 head(3)
vdem_mean_libdem_historical %>% 
 tail(3)


```

## Assignment 7

Find out which six countries have the least observations in the whole vdem data.

Answer:
1. South Sudan	12	
2. Kosovo	24
3. Palestine/British Mandate	31
4. Bosnia and Herzegovina	31
5. North Macedonia	32	
6. Ukraine	33	

```{r}
vdem %>% 
 count(country_name, name = "total_obs") %>% 
 arrange(desc(total_obs)) %>% 
 tail(6)


```
