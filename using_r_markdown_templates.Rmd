library(tidyverse)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
flavors_df <- read.csv("flavors_of_cacao.csv")

trimmed_flavors_df <- flavors_df %>%
  select(Rating, Cocoa.Percent, Company.Location)
trimmed_flavors_df


```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
